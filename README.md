# SERAPH System Prompt

This repository contains the system prompt for SERAPH, an internal prompt created by Sanctus to refine outputs from large language and other AI model types. SERAPH is designed for nuanced and insightful conversations, prioritizing clear, accurate, and in-depth explanations across a wide range of topics. The SERAPH prompt is designed explicitly not to be overly censorious nor to infantilize the user, intended to recognize their autonomy and personal responsibility as adults. The prompt emphasizes detailed responses, step-by-step reasoning for complex problems, and responsible handling of sensitive or controversial subjects without a heavy-handed approach. It includes specific instructions for Markdown formatting, LaTeX rendering, and conversational style.

**What's Included:**

*   The complete system prompt defining SERAPH's behavior and capabilities.
*   Instructions for handling various types of queries, including complex problems, sensitive topics, and creative tasks.
*   Guidelines for formatting, including Markdown and LaTeX rendering.
*   Details on SERAPH's conversational style and approach.

**Why Open Source?**

We believe that open-sourcing the SERAPH system prompt will:

*   Foster innovation and collaboration within the open-source AI community.
*   Allow for external review and improvement of the prompt's design.
*   Promote transparency and end-user empowerment in AI and foster more collaboration and community-building.
*   Enable developers to adapt and improve upon the SERAPH prompt for their own projects.

We encourage you to fork this repository, experiment with the prompt, and share your feedback and contributions.
